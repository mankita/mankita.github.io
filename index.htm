            SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.
            <p> Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA </p>
            <p data-actor="larte">LAERTES</p>
            <p data-actor="larte"> My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:<br />
                And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br />
                And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br />
                But let me hear from you.</p>
            <p data-actor="ophelia">OPHELIA</p>
            <p data-actor="ophelia"> Do you doubt that?</p>
            <p data-actor="larte">LAERTES</p>
            <p data-actor="larte"> For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br />
                Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br />
                A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br />
                Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br />
                The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
            <p data-actor="ophelia">OPHELIA</p>
            <p data-actor="ophelia"> No more but so?</p>
            <p data-actor="larte">LAERTES</p>
            <p data-actor="larte"> Think it no more;<br />
                For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br />
                In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br />
                The inward service of the mind and soul<br />
                Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br />
                And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br />
                The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br />
                His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;<br />
                For he himself is subject to his birth:<br />
                He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br />
                Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br />
                The safety and health of this whole state;<br />
                And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br />
                Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br />
                Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br />
                It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br />
                As he in his particular act and place<br />
                May give his saying deed; which is no further<br />
                Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br />
                Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br />
                If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br />
                Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br />
                To his unmaster'd importunity.<br />
                Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br />
                And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br />
                Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br />
                The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br />
                If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br />
                Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:<br />
                The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br />
                Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br />
                And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br />
                Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br />
                Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br />
                Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>

            <p data-actor="ophelia"> I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br />
                As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br />
                Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br />
                Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br />
                Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,<br />
                Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br />
                And recks not his own rede.</p>
